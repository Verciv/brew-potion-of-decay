# About This Project  

I simply wanted to just make a recipe to craft Potions of Decay on Minecraft Bedrock, that's it.  

## Brewing  

- Make 1-3 `awkward potions`.  
- Obtain `blaze powder` and a `wither rose`.
- Place the `awkward potions` at the bottom of the brewing stand and the `wither rose` at the top.  

## Installation  

- Extract the `.zip` file with your preferred program.  
- You will see two files, another `.zip` file and this `README.md` file.  
- Extract the `.zip` file.
- Open the file ending with the `.mcpack` extension and it will install to behavior packs.

## Activation  

- To activate this behavior pack, make sure to go to `Behavior Packs` in your game settings and find the pack titled `Potions of Decay Brewing Recipe` and press `Activate`.
- You can now craft potions of decay by brewing a wither rose inside a brewing stand!
